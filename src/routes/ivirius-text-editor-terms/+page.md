# Privacy Policy for Ivirius Text Editor and Ivirius Text Editor Plus

*Last updated: 23.06.2025*

**Ivirius™ Community** (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy and is dedicated to safeguarding your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, utilize, and disclose information when you use Ivirius Text Editor and Ivirius Text Editor Plus (collectively, the “Apps”).

### 1. Information We Collect

- **Usage Data:** When you access and use the Apps, both we and Microsoft may collect technical data, including but not limited to application version, device specifications, and crash reports. This information is utilized exclusively to maintain and enhance the performance and functionality of the Apps.
  
- **Feedback Data (Plus Version Only):** Should you provide feedback by reacting with a thumbs up or thumbs down to messages generated by Zippy's (AI) within Ivirius Text Editor Plus, such feedback, along with the corresponding message content, will be transmitted to a private Discord webhook hosted on our servers. This data is collected solely for the purpose of improving the AI interaction experience.
  

### 2. How We Use Your Information

- To deliver, operate, and maintain the functionality of the Apps.
  
- To analyze usage patterns and diagnose technical issues to improve app stability and performance.
  
- To process and utilize feedback received from users of the Plus version in order to enhance the capabilities and user experience of Zippy’s AI features.
  

### 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

- We do **not** sell, trade, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes.
  
- Feedback data transmitted to our private Discord webhook is securely stored and accessible only to authorized personnel within the Ivirius team, solely for the purpose of improving the AI features.
  
- We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal investigation.
  

### 4. Data Security

We employ industry-standard technical and organizational measures to safeguard your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. While we take responsibility for securing the data we collect directly, any data collected and stored by Microsoft through the use of the Apps is managed in accordance with Microsoft’s own privacy and security policies.

### 5. Your Choices and Rights

You have the option to withhold feedback by choosing not to react to messages with thumbs up or thumbs down in the Plus version of the App. This will prevent any related feedback data from being collected or transmitted.

If you have any questions regarding your personal data or wish to request the deletion of any feedback data we have collected, please contact us [here](https://ivirius.com/contact). We will respond to such requests in accordance with applicable laws and strive to address your concerns promptly.

Please note that the Apps run on the Windows operating system, which may collect diagnostic and usage data (commonly referred to as “telemetry”). This telemetry data is collected and managed separately by Microsoft and is governed by Microsoft’s privacy policies and user settings. Ivirius Community does not have access to or control over this telemetry data.

### 6. Children’s Privacy

The Apps are designed for users of all ages and are available to everyone through the Microsoft Store. However, some AI-driven features, such as interactions with Zippy’s AI, may produce content that is unpredictable and may not be appropriate for younger users.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or the functionality of the Apps. When we make significant changes, we will notify you by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this document and, where appropriate, provide additional notice through the Apps or other communication channels.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how we collect, use, and protect your information. Your continued use of the Apps after any updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
